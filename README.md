## 🎮 **About the Game**
This is a simple and fun implementation of the Snake Game, where the player controls the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body. The snake grows with each food it eats, and the score increases accordingly.

- **Score Tracking**: A live score display updates as you play.
